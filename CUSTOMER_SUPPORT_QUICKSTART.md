## Common Questions

**Q: Why 6 models instead of 1?**
A: Different customers think about value differently. Some care about cost-per-agent, others about deflection, others about productivity. Multiple models = faster closes.

**Q: Why geography matters?**
A: A support agent in India costs 1/5 what one costs in the US. Fair pricing captures that reality while maintaining margins everywhere.

**Q: Can we change the assumptions?**
A: Yes! Click "Edit Assumptions" to customize:
- Human costs by region
- LLM and infrastructure costs
- Performance benchmarks
- Commercial terms

**Q: What if customers want something not in the calculator?**
A: The calculator is a **starting point**. For complex deals:
1. Use calculator to establish baseline
2. Customize in AskScrooge.ai platform
3. Export pricing logic to contract

**Q: How do we measure success?**
A: Monitor these KPIs:
- Calculator visits (via Google Analytics)
- Model selection distribution
