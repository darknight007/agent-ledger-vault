## What Was Fixed
1. ✅ Fixed analytics function type annotation
2. ✅ Fixed displayMetrics type definition
3. ✅ Added proper CalculationResults interface

## Current Status

- ✅ Code pushed to GitHub
- 🔨 Vercel: **REBUILDING NOW** (1-2 minutes)

## Next Steps
1. Wait 1-2 minutes for Vercel to build and deploy
2. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard to check status
3. Once green ✅ "READY", test the URLs:

   - https://askscrooge.com/pricing-blueprints/social-content-creator-agent
